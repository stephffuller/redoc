## How do I enable the Console API?

Redocly API Reference Docs supports the Console API, though it is disabled by default. You can enable it in 'API Reference Settings'->'Live Configuration'. Redoc Community Edition does not support the Console API.

## Redoc Community Edition is not rendering my large json file smoothly.

Consider upgrading. Redocly API Reference Docs includes an option to section files.

    referenceDocs:
       layout:
         scope: section

If upgrading is not an option, simplifying your schema or reducing file size can both help to improve performance.

## Does Redocly support webhooks with OpenAPI 3.1?

Yes, Redocly supports OpenAPI 3.1 webhooks. See [\#1304](https://github.com/Redocly/redoc/pull/1304) for more information.

## How do I adjust the theme settings on a page, such as color, line spacing, and fonts?

Redoc.ly API Reference Docs supports themes, with a limited subset of theme features supported by Redoc Community Edition. Discover more information on configuring page themes [here](https://redoc.ly/docs/cli/configuration/reference-docs/#theming).

## Where can I locate Docker images for Redocly and redoc cli?

[Redoc Docker Image](https://hub.docker.com/r/redocly/redoc)  
[redoc.cli Docker Image](https://hub.docker.com/r/broothie/redoc-cli). See [\#1158](https://github.com/Redocly/redoc/pull/1158) for more information.  

## Which tag should I use for operations that cannot be logically grouped?

When `x-tagGroups` is enabled, each tag must have a group or it will not be displayed. For operations that cannot be logically grouped, use the `other` group/tag. By default, Lint your API definition to ensure that each path has a tag using the [operation-tag-defined](https://redoc.ly/docs/cli/built-in-rules/#operation-tag-defined) built-in rule. Note that there is no built-in rule to check that tags aren't missing from the `x-tagGroups` groups definitions.

## Which vendor extensions does Redocly support?

You can view the list of supported vendor extensions [here](https://redoc.ly/docs/api-reference-docs/vendor-extensions/redoc-supported-extensions/).
